This is the process scheduling simulator for OOPs + OS assignment made by Sidharth Kumar (19/11/EC/044). 

It simulates 3 scheduling algorithms :-
    1. First Come First Serve
    2. Shortest Remaing Time First
    3. Round Robin

To run the program, just download this repo's code and compile "main.cpp" in the project folder. You will be prompted for input required for the simulation. Then in "result.txt", you will find the final results of the simulation (CT, TAT, WT, RT, etc) and in "status.txt" the various events will be logged.

3 main classes used :- 
    1. Process
    2. ProcessCreator
    3. Simulator
